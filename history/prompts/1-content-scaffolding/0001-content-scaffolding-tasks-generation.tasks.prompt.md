## Prompt

```text
/sp.tasks

Generate an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for the content-scaffolding feature based on available design artifacts (spec.md and plan.md).
```

## Response

```text
Generated tasks.md at specs/1-content-scaffolding/tasks.md with:

- Total Tasks: 51
- Setup Tasks: 2 (verify structure, remove tutorial placeholders)
- Foundational Tasks: 2 (sidebar configuration updates)
- User Story 1 (Introduction): 3 tasks
- User Story 2 (Modules): 24 tasks (6 per module x 4 modules)
- User Story 3 (Hardware): 5 tasks
- User Story 4 (Weekly): 5 tasks
- User Story 5 (Assessments): 4 tasks
- User Story 6 (Validation): 3 tasks
- Polish Tasks: 3 tasks

Key decisions:
- Mapped 6 user scenarios from spec.md to 6 user stories
- All content creation tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Sidebar uses autogenerated dirName pattern - content files auto-discovered
- MVP scope: Phase 1-3 (Setup + Foundational + Introduction)
- High parallelization opportunity - most tasks are independent file creations
```
