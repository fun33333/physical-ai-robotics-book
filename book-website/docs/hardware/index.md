# Hardware Guide for Physical AI

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive guidance on selecting and setting up hardware for your Physical AI projects. Whether you're a student on a tight budget or an institution planning a robotics lab, this guide will help you make informed decisions about the components you need.

Physical AI bridges the gap between digital intelligence and the physical world. To truly understand and develop embodied AI systems, you'll need appropriate hardware for computation, sensing, actuation, and environmental interaction.

## Hardware Categories

Our hardware recommendations are organized into four main categories:

1. **Computational Platforms** - GPUs, CPUs, and embedded systems for running AI models
2. **Sensing Systems** - Cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and other sensors for perceiving the environment
3. **Actuation Systems** - Motors, servos, and mechanisms for interacting with the physical world
4. **Robot Platforms** - Complete robot kits and platforms for testing algorithms

For each category, we provide three tiers:
- **Budget**: Entry-level options for individual students
- **Recommended**: Balanced performance and cost for most applications
- **Premium**: High-performance options for advanced research

## Prerequisites

Before making hardware purchases, ensure you understand:
- Basic electronics and circuit assembly
- Power supply requirements for your components
- Space requirements for hardware setup

## Learning Outcomes

After reviewing this guide, you'll be able to:
- Select appropriate computational hardware for different types of AI workloads
- Compare sensing options based on your specific needs
- Understand the trade-offs between different robot platforms
- Plan a hardware budget that fits your requirements

## Getting Started

Start with our [required hardware specifications](./required-hardware.md) if you want a complete setup, explore [budget alternatives](./budget-alternatives.md) if you're price-sensitive, or focus on [specific components](./sensor-selection.md) that match your immediate needs. We also have detailed guidance on [setting up your development workstation](./workstation-setup.md) and choosing among [various robot platforms](./robot-platforms.md).

## Cost Considerations

Hardware expenses can range from under $500 for educational projects to over $50,000 for research-grade systems. We provide detailed pricing tables throughout this guide to help you plan your investment effectively.
