### Prerequisites

Before starting this course:

- **Programming**: Intermediate Python skills (functions, classes, modules)
- **Mathematics**: Basic linear algebra and calculus concepts
- **Linux**: Comfortable with command line and file system navigation
- **Electronics**: Basic understanding of circuits, sensors, and actuators (Week 5+)

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this 8-week curriculum, students will:

- Master ROS 2 core concepts and communication patterns
- Build and simulate complete robotic systems
- Integrate hardware components with software systems
- Deploy GPU-accelerated perception and control systems
- Understand state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models
- Complete a capstone project integrating all learned concepts

## Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Focus Area | Prerequisites | Checkpoint |
|------|------------|---------------|------------|
| [Week 1-2](./week-01-02.md) | ROS 2 Fundamentals | Python, Linux | Run first ROS 2 node |
| [Week 3-4](./week-03-04.md) | Simulation Systems | ROS 2 knowledge | Teleoperate simulated robot |
| [Week 5-6](./week-05-06.md) | Hardware & Isaac | ROS 2, Simulation | Deploy GPU-accelerated perception |
| [Week 7-8](./week-07-08.md) | VLA Systems | All previous | Capstone project completion |

## Assessment Strategy

Each week includes:
- **Daily activities**: Hands-on exercises and coding challenges
- **Knowledge checks**: Quizzes to verify understanding
- **Weekly project**: Building toward the final capstone
- **Peer review**: Collaborative learning and feedback

## Getting Started

Begin with [Week 1-2](./week-01-02.md) to establish your ROS 2 foundations. Each week builds on the previous, so it's important to progress in order, though some flexibility is possible if needed.

The curriculum is designed to be completed in 8 weeks of full-time study (40 hours/week) or 16 weeks of part-time study (20 hours/week).
