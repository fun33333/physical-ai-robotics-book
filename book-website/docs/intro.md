# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book**! This comprehensive guide will take you through the fascinating world of building intelligent robotic systems that can perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of advanced artificial intelligence with real-world robotics. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital domains, Physical AI systems must:

- **Perceive** the physical world through sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs)
- **Reason** about spatial relationships, physics, and task requirements
- **Act** through motors and actuators to manipulate objects and navigate environments
- **Learn** from real-world interactions and adapt to new situations

This field is experiencing explosive growth as advances in deep learning, computer vision, and robotics hardware converge to enable truly intelligent machines.

## Why Learn Physical AI Now?

The robotics industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation:

:::info Industry Growth
- The global robotics market is projected to reach $260 billion by 2030
- Demand for robotics engineers has grown 40% year-over-year
- Major tech companies (NVIDIA, Google, Tesla, Amazon) are heavily investing in humanoid robots
- Breakthroughs in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are enabling robots to understand natural language commands
:::

Whether you are aiming to work at a robotics startup, join a research lab, or build your own robotic systems, the skills you will develop in this course are in high demand.

## What You Will Build

By the end of this 8-week curriculum, you will have hands-on experience with:

1. **ROS 2 Applications** - Build robot control systems using the industry-standard Robot Operating System
2. **Simulated Robots** - Create and test robots in Gazebo and Unity before deploying to hardware
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Workflows** - Leverage GPU-accelerated simulation and perception
4. **VLA Model Integration** - Connect cutting-edge AI models to robotic systems

## Course Structure

This book is organized into four core modules plus supporting materials:

| Module | Focus | Key Skills |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Module 1** | ROS 2 Fundamentals | Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions, Navigation |
| **Module 2** | Simulation | Gazebo, Unity, URDF, Digital Twins |
| **Module 3** | NVIDIA Isaac | Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Isaac Lab, RL |
| **Module 4** | VLA Systems | Vision models, Language integration, RT-2 |

Each module includes:
- Conceptual explanations with diagrams
- Complete code examples you can run
- Hands-on exercises with expected outputs
- A capstone project to demonstrate mastery

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this course, you should have:

- **Python programming** - Comfortable writing Python functions and classes
- **Linux basics** - Familiar with terminal commands and file navigation
- **Basic math** - Linear algebra and probability fundamentals (we will review as needed)

:::tip Do Not Worry!
If you are missing some prerequisites, each module includes links to recommended resources. Many students successfully complete this course while learning these skills alongside.

## Hardware Requirements

You can complete most of this course using only simulation. For the full experience:

| Tier | What You Need | Cost |
|------|---------------|------|
| **Minimum** | Ubuntu 22.04 (or WSL2), 16GB RAM | Free |
| **Recommended** | + NVIDIA GPU (RTX 3060+) | ~$350+ |
| **Advanced** | + Physical robot (TurtleBot4) | ~$1300+ |

See the [Hardware Guide](/docs/hardware/) for detailed recommendations at every budget level.

## How to Use This Book

**Self-paced learners**: Work through the modules sequentially. Each builds on the previous one, with clear checkpoints to verify your understanding.

**Instructors**: The [Weekly Breakdown](/docs/weekly-breakdown/) provides a ready-to-use 8-week syllabus with daily activities and assessments.

**Reference users**: Use the sidebar navigation to jump directly to specific topics. Each page is designed to stand alone while linking to related concepts.
