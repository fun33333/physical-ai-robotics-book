# Tasks: Content Structure Scaffolding for Physical AI Book

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-content-scaffolding/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: No tests requested - this is a content scaffolding task.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Docusaurus docs**: `book-website/docs/`
- **Sidebar config**: `book-website/sidebars.ts`

---

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Introduction): Can proceed immediately after Phase 2
  - US2 (Modules): Can proceed in parallel with US1
  - US3 (Hardware): Can proceed in parallel with US1/US2
  - US4 (Weekly): Can proceed in parallel with US1/US2/US3
  - US5 (Assessments): Can proceed in parallel with all above
  - US6 (Build Validation): Depends on US1-US5 completion
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1/US2/US3
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1-US4
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: DEPENDS on US1-US5 completion (build validation requires all content)

### Within Each User Story

- All markdown file creation tasks within a story are parallelizable
- Index files should ideally be created before chapter files (but not strictly required due to autogeneration)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks can run sequentially (T001 → T002)
- Foundational tasks T003, T004 modify the same file - run sequentially
- Once Foundational phase completes, US1-US5 can start in parallel
- Within each module in US2, all chapter files can be created in parallel
- Within US3 (Hardware), all pages can be created in parallel
- Within US4 (Weekly), all week pages can be created in parallel
- Within US5 (Assessments), all pages can be created in parallel (after directory creation)

---

## Parallel Execution Example: User Story 2 (Modules)

```bash
# All Module 1 chapter files can be created in parallel:
Task: "Create book-website/docs/module-1/ros2-fundamentals.md"
Task: "Create book-website/docs/module-1/ros2-nodes-topics-services.md"
Task: "Create book-website/docs/module-1/ros2-actions-lifecycle.md"
Task: "Create book-website/docs/module-1/ros2-navigation.md"
Task: "Create book-website/docs/module-1/ros2-manipulation.md"

# All 4 modules can also be worked on in parallel by different agents
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (sidebar config)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Introduction pages)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Build site and test Introduction navigation
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Introduction) → Test → Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (All Modules) → Test → Deploy
4. Add User Story 3 (Hardware) → Test → Deploy
5. Add User Story 4 (Weekly) → Test → Deploy
6. Add User Story 5 (Assessments) → Test → Deploy
7. Complete User Story 6 (Build Validation) → Final verification

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers/agents:

1. Complete Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Agent A: User Story 1 (Introduction)
   - Agent B: User Story 2 - Modules 1 & 2
   - Agent C: User Story 2 - Modules 3 & 4
   - Agent D: User Stories 3, 4, 5 (Hardware, Weekly, Assessments)
3. All agents complete → Run User Story 6 (Build Validation)

| **Foundational Tasks** | 2 |
| **US1 (Introduction)** | 3 tasks |
| **US2 (Modules)** | 24 tasks (6 per module × 4 modules) |
| **US3 (Hardware)** | 5 tasks |
| **US4 (Weekly)** | 5 tasks |
| **US5 (Assessments)** | 4 tasks |
| **US6 (Validation)** | 3 tasks |
| **Polish Tasks** | 3 tasks |
| **Parallel Opportunities** | High - most content creation tasks are parallelizable |
| **Suggested MVP** | Phase 1-3 (Setup + Foundational + Introduction) |

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each phase or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All markdown files must include placeholder text with "Detailed content coming in Phase 3."
